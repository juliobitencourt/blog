[Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) is an all-in-one end-to-end testing tool.
With Cypress you write your tests in plain JavaScript and it will run it in the browser (and even in Electron) as it was a real user.

Debug your code visually and run your tests in your [continuous integration builds](/continuous-integration-with-laravel-bitbucket-pipelines).

Let's use Cypress to test a simple Ajax form.

First. Install it via npm...
```shell
npm install cypress --save-dev
```
... or yarn
```shell
yarn add cypress --dev
```

Then open it

```shell
npx cypress open
```

If you're not using npm or yarn you can just download the app

## Let's write the first test using Cypress.js

Create a file called **my_test.cy.js**

Tests in Cypress are called "Specs"

And dont forget to turn Intellisense on. Add the line bellow to the beginning of your spec file.

```javascript
/// <reference types="cypress" />
```

First. Visit a page and assert it has some value:

```javascript
it('Fills the customer form', () => {
    cy.visit('http://my-awesome-website.test/')
    cy.contains('My Awesome Form')
});
```

Pretty simple. It's like jQuery but for your tests.

Type in some fields and submit a form? Piece of cake

```javascript
it('Fills the customer form', () => {
    cy.visit('http://my-awesome-website.test/')
    cy.contains('My Awesome Form')
    cy.get('input[name=name]').type('Julio Bitencourt')
    cy.get('input[name=website]').type('juliobitencourt.dev')
    cy.get('#submit-button').click()
});
```

## Catch ajax requests and check the responses with Cypress

```javascript
it('Fills the customer form', () => {
    cy.visit('http://my-awesome-website.test/')
    cy.contains('My Awesome Form')
    cy.get('input[name=name]').type('Julio Bitencourt')
    cy.get('input[name=website]').type('juliobitencourt.dev')

    cy.intercept('http://my-awesome-website.test/submit-form.php').as('submitForm')
    cy.get('form').submit()
    cy.wait('@submitForm').its('response.statusCode').should('eq', 201)

    cy.get('h1').should('contain', 'Customer successfully created!')
});
```

## Resize the viewport and take screenshots with Cypress

```javascript
  it('Take some screenshots', () => {
    cy.viewport(550, 750) // Set viewport to 550px x 750px
    cy.visit('http://my-awesome-website.test/')
    cy.contains('Show Modal').click()
    cy.get("#modal").should('be.visible')
    cy.screenshot()

    cy.get('#modal button').click()
    cy.wait(1000) // wait the end of the transition
    cy.get("#modal").should('not.be.visible')
    cy.screenshot()
  })
});
```

It is important to note something:
E2E testing is only one of several types of automated testing aproaches but it's the best one for beginners IMHO.

Start with the basics and go further with this great tool!
